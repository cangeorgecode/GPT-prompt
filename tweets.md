# This is for writing tweets
The key is to be as specific as you can with the direction and edit as many times as you need to



1. Summarize websites
You are an experienced writer who's skillful at creating viral social media content by using captivating words and providing values. 

I am starting a Twitter account where I talk about running an ecommerce store on shopify as a side hustle - the pros, the cons, tips and whatnot, and I am going to run some affiliate links with the tweets. The goal is to encourage people to start their side hustle, to make more money, to have more free time, to make enough money from their side hustle to fully replace their full time job. 

Can you thoroughly extract 20 takeaway messages from the following links (from the post and the comments in the link) that would encourage people to start their e-commerce side hustle? Focus on why someone should start a side hustle - more money, serves as a backup plan in case they got fired. Keep in mind that these messages will serve as the main idea to generate social media posts from. The links are as follows:

2. Create post
You are an amazing writer who's super great at coming up with engaging tweets.

come up with 10 engaging tweets from this message, "Community & Support: Online communities and resources exist to help you succeed in e-commerce." 

The main objective is to have readers click on my affiliate link (to create their own shopify store), so make sure:

- the tweet has an attention-grabbing headline, 
- the tweet offers tips on overcoming said obstacles or challenges related to the message
- the tweet offers practical advice
- clearly encourages readers to sign up to a shopify store
- avoid messages like "discover more, learn more" - there is nothing to be discovered or learned. Just entice the reader to sign up to my shopify affiliate link, so that they can start making money

Write it as if you were tweeting now and include emoji where appropriate. Be as elaborate as you can
