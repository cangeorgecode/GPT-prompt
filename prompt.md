### Idea Generation

I run a blog aimed about building digital assets to create passive income. I want to help stay-at-home parents, people who want to quit their job one day to build a passive income stream. 

Come up with 10 ideas that I could write about on my blog. For each idea, suggest 3 different titles.

Gather inspiration from other blogs and websites that talk about similar topics.


### Coming up with keywords and long-tail keywords to target by giving a search intent

I want to write about "From Hobby to Income: Creating Profitable Online Courses" for my blog. It should aim at people who have a teachable skill and they want to share this knowledge while making some money.

However, they might not know how to get started, how long does it take, how much work to put into it, how much will it cost them, what are the risks. The search intent should be informational. 

Can you brainstorm some related keywords and long tail keywords?
